# Silk
Adds general utils for making mods that don't quite belong in FabricAPI

## Importing
Silk is accessible on the Fabric Maven. You don't need to add it to your
repositories, since you need the maven for any Fabric development. Add it to
your dependencies like so:

```gradle
modCompile "io.github.prospector.silk:SilkAPI:<version>"
```
